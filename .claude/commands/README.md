# Custom Slash Commands

Place custom slash commands here as `.md` files.

## Example

Create a file `deploy.md`:

```markdown
Deploy the website to production:
1. Build the production bundle
2. Run tests
3. Upload to hosting provider
4. Clear CDN cache

```

Then use `/deploy` in Claude Code to execute.
