### Option 1: The Origin Story

After years of building in the background, I'm excited to officially introduce Myro Productions to the world.

I'm Nicolas Myers (but you can call me Myro), and I've spent the last several years deep in the trenches of AWS cloud architecture, AI development, and building systems that actually work. Recently, I earned my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and I'm currently working toward Solutions Architect Associate -- because I believe in constantly leveling up.

Myro Productions is where cloud meets creativity. Whether you need AWS infrastructure that scales, AI integrations that solve real problems, web applications built with modern frameworks like Next.js, or help setting up a home lab that rivals enterprise setups -- I've got you covered.

I run my own home lab complete with Mac Mini servers, DGX Spark GPU systems, Docker containers, and full monitoring stacks. Why? Because I don't just talk about technology -- I live it.

Let's make technology work for you.

### Option 2: The Problem-Solver Approach

Technology should empower your business, not complicate it.

Welcome to Myro Productions -- where AWS cloud services, AI development, web design, and home lab consulting come together. I'm Nicolas Myers (Myro), and I help businesses and individuals harness technology that actually delivers results.

Fresh off earning my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and deep into studying for Solutions Architect Associate, I'm combining hands-on expertise with cutting-edge knowledge to serve clients who want more than cookie-cutter solutions.

What sets Myro Productions apart? Real-world experience. I maintain a production home lab environment with enterprise-grade infrastructure -- because the best way to understand technology is to use it every day.

Services include:
- AWS cloud architecture and migration
- AI development and integration
- Custom web applications (Next.js/React)
- Web hosting solutions
- Home lab consulting and setup
- Remote work infrastructure

Let's connect and talk about what's possible. Visit myroproductions.com or contact me at nmyers@myroproductions.com / (317) 563-1247.

### Option 3: The Direct Introduction

Building is what I do. Problem-solving is what I love.

I'm Nicolas Myers, founder of Myro Productions, and this page is where I'm bringing together everything I'm passionate about: AWS cloud services, AI development, web design, home lab engineering, and remote work solutions.

With fresh AWS Cloud Practitioner certification in hand and Solutions Architect Associate studies underway, I'm combining formal credentials with years of hands-on experience running production systems, building AI-powered applications, and designing infrastructure that scales.

My home lab isn't a hobby -- it's a proving ground. Mac Mini servers, DGX Spark GPU systems, Docker orchestration, Grafana/Prometheus monitoring -- if I'm recommending it to clients, I've already stress-tested it myself.

Whether you're a business looking to modernize your infrastructure, a startup needing web development, or someone who wants to build their own powerful home lab -- I'm here to help make it happen.
