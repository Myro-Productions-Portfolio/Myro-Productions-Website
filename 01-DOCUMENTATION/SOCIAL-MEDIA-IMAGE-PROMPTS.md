## General Color Palette Guidelines

**Brand Color Palette:**
- Primary: Deep navy blue (#0A1929) and charcoal black (#1A1A1A)
- Accent: Electric teal (#00D9FF) and cyan (#00FFFF)
- Highlight: Matrix green (#00FF41) used sparingly
- Neutral: White (#FFFFFF) for text and highlights

**Consistent Elements Across All Images:**
- Premium, professional aesthetic
- Dark backgrounds to convey sophistication
- Teal/cyan accent lighting as signature brand color
- Mix of physical hardware and abstract digital visualization
- Clean, modern, uncluttered compositions
- Space reserved for text overlays where needed

**Text Overlay Recommendations:**
- "Myro Productions - Now Live"
- "Cloud. AI. Innovation."
- "myroproductions.com"
- "AWS Architecture | AI Development | Web Solutions"

**Avoid:**
- AV/event production imagery (speakers, stages, lighting rigs)
- Generic stock photo aesthetics
- Overly warm tones (conflicts with tech-forward positioning)
- Pastel colors (too soft for the brand)

## Implementation Notes

1. All prompts are designed for modern AI image generators (Midjourney v6+, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion XL)
2. Emphasize "professional," "cinematic," and "commercial" throughout for quality results
3. Teal/cyan palette differentiates from generic "corporate blue" while maintaining professionalism
4. Mix of physical hardware and digital visualization establishes both hands-on and cloud expertise
5. High contrast and sharp details ensure images work well at both large and thumbnail sizes
6. May need to regenerate multiple times to get composition right
7. Use "no text" in prompt if the generator adds unwanted text
